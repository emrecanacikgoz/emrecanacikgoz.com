We present Hippocrates, an open-source LLM framework specifically developed for the medical domain. Also, we introduce Hippo, a family of 7B models tailored for the medical domain, fine-tuned from Mistral and LLaMA2 through continual pre-training, instruction tuning, and reinforcement learning from human and AI feedback.
