This paper describes the winning model in [MRL: The 1st Shared Task on Multilingual Clause-level Morphology](https://sigtyp.github.io/st2022-mrl.html). We present our work for all three sections of the shared task: inflection, reinflection, and analysis. Our approach received 1st place in all three tasks in MRL'22.
